    # A  non-interactive C project that practicing the following:
    
    Structures
        Identify the right fields from a given text file
        Create and use a struct with those fields
        
    Files I\O
        Read and write from\to a text file
        Search
    
    Parameters
        Use Argc, Argv parameters
    
    Strings    
        Practicing <String.h> functions
        Tokens (for ex. ignore "#" etc.)
        
# Files in repo
    Mirsham.txt - a text file that includes the full citizens list (see instructions for more details)
    Mirsham.c - the code 
    
# Note:
    You are looking at my first project practicing structures, strings, files I\O and parameters use.
    At that point i did not study multiple files compilation modules yet, so the whole program is in one main file.
    In later projects you'll see an implementation of mutiple compilation modules.
