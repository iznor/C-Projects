# Storage
    # A  non-interactive C project that practicing the following:
    
    Structures
        Identify the right fields according to the functionality instructions
        Multiple structs implementation ("a struct inside a struct")
    
    Files I\O
        Read and write from\to a text file
        Search
    
    Parameters
        Use Argc, Argv parameters
    
    Strings    
        Practicing <String.h> functions
        Tokens (for ex. ignore char '-' etc.)
        
    Dynamic Memory Allocations
        Malloc, Calloc, Realloc
        Null pointer tests
        Free allocated memory
        0 memory leaks
        
# Files in repo
    Instructions.pdf - a detailed instructions file that shows all the functionaities of the program (Hebrew)
    Storage.txt - a text file that includes the list of instructions that the program reads from
                  (see "Instructions.pdf" for more details)
    Storage.c - the code
    
# Note:
    At that point i did not study multiple files compilation modules yet, so the whole program is in one main file.
    In later projects you'll see an implementation of mutiple compilation modules.
