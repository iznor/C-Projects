# ADT Modules
    
    # An Implementation of "String": an Abstract Data Type Module
    
    # A  non-interactive C project that practicing the following:
    
    Multiple Files Compilation Modules
        Compile multiple files into one output.
        An implementation of a "makefile"
        
    Advanced C Programming
        Macro, Enumeration, etc.
        
    Abstract Data Types Modules
        Encapsulation of the code
        Introduction to OOP
    
    Header Files
        The use of header files (declerations, structures, #includes, etc.)
        Guard (#ifndef, #define, #endif...)
        Given some "main.c" file - I was expected to identiify the right abstract structures, declerations and to  
        implement those correctly.
    
    Structures
        Identify the right fields from a given text file
        Create and use a struct with those fields
        
    Dynamic Memory Allocations
        Malloc, Calloc, Realloc
        Null pointer tests
        Free allocated memory
        0 memory leaks
        
    Strings
        Advanced use of <string.h> library
        
# Files in repo
    "stringADT.h" - header file of the ADT
    "stringADT.c" - implementations of the ADT
    "App_StringADT.c" - an example of a main file on which the code is implemented (partly-given)
    "makefile" - run and compile the program more efficiently with this handy automation tool
    "output.jpeg" - a screenshot of the output
