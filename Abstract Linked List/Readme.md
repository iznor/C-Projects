# Abstract Linked List
    # A  non-interactive C project that practicing the following:
    
    Multiple Files Compilation Modules
        Compile multiple files into one output.

    Header Files
        The use of header files (declerations, structures, #includes, etc.)
        Guard (#ifndef, #define, #endif...)
        Given some "main.c" file - I was expected to identiify the right abstract structures, declerations and to  
        implement those correctly.
        
    Advanced C Programming
        Pointers to functions
        Enum
    
    Structures
        Identify the right fields from a given text file
        Create and use a struct with those fields
        
    Dynamic Memory Allocations
        Malloc, Calloc, Realloc
        Null pointer tests
        Free allocated memory
        0 memory leaks
        
# Files in repo
    "Instructions.pdf" - a detailed instructions file that shows all the functionaities of the program (Hebrew)
    "Abll.h" - header file of the abstract linked list struct & declarations
    "Abll.c" - implementation of the header file
    "main_Students.c" - an example of a main file on which the code is implemented (given)
    "main_guild.c" - another example of a main file on which the code is implemented (given)
